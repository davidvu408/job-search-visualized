# Job Search Visualized
An array of visualizations using D3.js, Node.js, and MySQL and data I've logged during my new grad job search

## Update: 02/17/2020
Originally this web page visualized meta data about the applications I sent during my new grad job search. I have since gotten a job offer via a recuiter reaching out to me on LinkedIn - something I did not account for. In any case, this project has been discontinued, although it was a great learning experience :)
